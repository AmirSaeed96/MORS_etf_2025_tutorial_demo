1,"What is quantum entanglement?","Quantum entanglement is a physical phenomenon in which two or more particles become correlated in such a way that the state of one particle cannot be fully described without referencing the state of the other(s), even when separated by large distances. Measurements on one particle instantaneously influence the state of its entangled partner, regardless of the distance between them. Entanglement is a key resource in quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and foundational tests of quantum mechanics.","", "quantum,entanglement,basics"
2,"What is a qubit and how is it different from a classical bit?","A qubit is the fundamental unit of quantum information. Unlike a classical bit, which can be either 0 or 1, a qubit can exist in a superposition of both 0 and 1 simultaneously. Qubits also support entanglement and quantum interference, enabling quantum algorithms to explore many computational paths in parallel. These properties give qubits computational advantages not available to classical bits.","", "quantum,qubits,computing"
3,"Explain the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.","The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that certain pairs of physical properties—most famously position and momentum—cannot both be measured with arbitrary precision at the same time. The more precisely one is known, the less precisely the other can be known. This is not due to measurement limitations but rather a fundamental property of quantum systems arising from wave–particle duality.","", "quantum,uncertainty,foundations"
4,"What is quantum superposition?","Quantum superposition is the principle that a quantum system can exist in multiple possible states simultaneously until it is measured. When a measurement occurs, the superposition collapses to one of the possible states. This principle underlies quantum interference and is essential to the power of quantum computation.","", "quantum,superposition,basics"
5,"What is the Schrödinger equation and why is it important?","The Schrödinger equation is the fundamental equation of non-relativistic quantum mechanics. It describes how the wavefunction of a quantum system evolves over time. The equation predicts the allowed energy levels of atoms and molecules and provides a framework for calculating probabilities of measurement outcomes. It plays a similar role in quantum mechanics as Newton’s laws do in classical mechanics.","", "quantum,schrodinger,math"
6,"What is quantum tunneling?","Quantum tunneling is a phenomenon where a particle passes through a potential barrier that it classically does not have enough energy to overcome. This occurs because the particle's wavefunction extends into the barrier with a nonzero probability. Tunneling is essential in nuclear fusion in stars, scanning tunneling microscopy, and modern semiconductor device operation.","", "quantum,tunneling,applications"
7,"What is the difference between fermions and bosons?","Fermions are particles that follow the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. Examples include electrons, protons, and neutrons. Bosons, such as photons and gluons, do not obey this rule and can occupy the same quantum state, enabling phenomena like lasers and Bose–Einstein condensates. The distinction arises from particle spin: fermions have half-integer spin, bosons have integer spin.","", "quantum,particles,fermions,bosons"
8,"What is wave–particle duality?","Wave–particle duality is the concept that quantum entities such as electrons and photons exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior. For example, they produce interference patterns in the double-slit experiment but also deliver energy in discrete packets. This duality is captured mathematically in the quantum wavefunction.","", "quantum,duality,foundations"
9,"How does quantum computing achieve speedups over classical computing?","Quantum computing achieves speedups through superposition, entanglement, and interference. These properties allow quantum algorithms—such as Shor’s for factoring and Grover’s for search—to explore computational possibilities in parallel and amplify correct answers. Quantum computers excel in specific structured problems but are not universally faster for all tasks.","", "quantum,computing,algorithms"
10,"What is decoherence in quantum mechanics?","Decoherence is the process by which a quantum system loses its quantum behavior—such as superposition and entanglement—due to interactions with its environment. These interactions cause the system's wavefunction to become entangled with environmental degrees of freedom, effectively collapsing the system into classical states. Decoherence is a major barrier to building stable quantum computers.","", "quantum,decoherence,noise"
