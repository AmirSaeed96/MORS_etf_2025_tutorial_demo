1,"Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in which two or more particles become linked so that the state of one cannot be described independently of the state of the others, even when they are separated by large distances. When one entangled particle is measured, its partner's state becomes determined instantaneously, regardless of distance, which puzzled Einstein and led him to call it “spooky action at a distance.” Entanglement is a foundational resource for quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum cryptography.","Particles can share linked states so measuring one instantly determines the other's state, enabling many quantum technologies.","quantum,entanglement,summarization"
2,"A qubit, or quantum bit, is the basic unit of quantum information. Unlike a classical bit that can only be 0 or 1, a qubit can exist in a superposition of both states simultaneously. Qubits also exhibit entanglement and interference, which allow quantum computers to process information in ways that classical computers cannot. These properties enable quantum algorithms to explore many computational paths at once, creating potential for exponential speedups in certain tasks.","A qubit can be both 0 and 1 at once and uses superposition and entanglement to enable quantum computing advantages.","quantum,qubit,computing"
3,"The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that certain pairs of physical quantities—such as position and momentum—cannot both be known with perfect accuracy at the same time. The more precisely one quantity is known, the less precisely the other can be determined. This limitation is not due to measurement imperfections but arises from the fundamental wave-like nature of particles in quantum mechanics. It reflects a key departure from classical physics and places natural limits on predictability.","Position and momentum cannot both be measured perfectly because of the fundamental wave nature of quantum particles.","quantum,uncertainty,foundations"
4,"Quantum superposition is the principle that a quantum system can exist in multiple possible states simultaneously until it is measured. Once a measurement occurs, the system collapses into one of the allowed states. Superposition enables quantum computers to test many possibilities in parallel and underlies key phenomena such as interference and quantum parallelism.","A quantum system can exist in multiple states at once until measured, enabling quantum parallelism.","quantum,superposition"
5,"The Schrödinger equation is the core mathematical equation of quantum mechanics. It describes how the wavefunction of a system evolves over time and provides a way to calculate allowed energy levels and probabilities of physical outcomes. Just as Newton's laws govern motion in classical physics, the Schrödinger equation governs the behavior of quantum systems and is essential for predicting atomic and molecular behavior.","The Schrödinger equation governs how quantum states evolve over time and predicts energy levels and measurement probabilities.","quantum,schrodinger,math"
6,"Quantum tunneling occurs when a particle passes through a barrier even though it does not have enough classical energy to overcome it. This happens because the particle's wavefunction extends into the barrier, giving it a nonzero probability of appearing on the other side. Tunneling is essential in nuclear fusion, the operation of scanning tunneling microscopes, and modern semiconductor devices.","Particles can sometimes cross barriers they lack the energy to overcome due to wavefunction penetration, enabling key technologies.","quantum,tunneling,applications"
7,"Fermions and bosons are two categories of particles distinguished by their quantum properties. Fermions, such as electrons, have half-integer spin and obey the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning no two identical fermions can share the same quantum state. Bosons, including photons, have integer spin and can occupy the same state, which allows phenomena like lasers and Bose–Einstein condensates. These differences shape the structure of matter and the behavior of quantum fields.","Fermions cannot share quantum states while bosons can, leading to very different physical behaviors.","quantum,particles,fermions,bosons"
8,"Wave–particle duality is the idea that quantum objects like electrons and photons exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. In experiments such as the double-slit setup, particles form interference patterns characteristic of waves, yet detection reveals localized impacts like particles. This duality is captured in the wavefunction formalism of quantum mechanics.","Quantum objects act like both waves and particles, depending on how they are measured.","quantum,duality"
9,"Quantum computing achieves speedups by leveraging superposition, entanglement, and interference. These quantum effects allow algorithms to explore many possible solutions in parallel and amplify correct answers. For example, Shor’s algorithm can factor large numbers exponentially faster than classical methods, and Grover’s algorithm can speed up unstructured search. Quantum computing is not universally faster, but excels at specific structured problems.","Quantum computing uses superposition and entanglement to explore many possibilities at once and boost correct outcomes.","quantum,computing,algorithms"
10,"Decoherence is the process by which a quantum system loses its quantum properties—such as superposition and entanglement—due to interactions with its environment. These interactions cause the system’s wavefunction to become entangled with external degrees of freedom, making the system behave more classically. Decoherence is a major challenge for quantum computing because it destroys fragile quantum states needed for computation.","Decoherence occurs when environmental interactions destroy quantum states, making systems behave classically.","quantum,decoherence,noise"
